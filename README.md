# PCOS-machine-learning

In this study, we used two experimental setups: one with all features and one with a subset of features selected using an embedded method to compare the performance of each machine learning model and see which approach works better for predicting the presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). 

For the study of predicting presence of PCOS using a dataset of 541 data points, we considered including the following algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGboosting

We will do a comparative analysis of the two setup to determine which model performs better under selected features.
